## Description

A Qt-based GUI application for generating stipple paintings and SLIC segmentations
from images, as well as other stylizations based on stippling and segmentation.
(SLIC is Simple Linear Iterative Clustering, referenced below.)

The project for which this application was developed is described in a series
of blog posts at: http://gigl.scs.carleton.ca/blog/51

I have removed the image stylization algorithms specific to the project
prior to making the rest of the code public. Please contact me if you need access to
the full codebase.

## Building Instructions

- Install Qt development tools.
  - Qt >= 5.6.0 and Qt Creator >= 4.0.0 were used for development. (Qt Creator
    is not necessary for building the project, as Qt projects can be built
    using command-line tools directly.)
- Open 'stippler/stippler.pro' with Qt Creator and build the project,
  or use the `qmake-qt5` command line program to build the project.
  - Example (for a Linux environment):
    `qmake-qt5 ./stippler/stippler.pro -r -spec linux-g++`

## Features and Operating Instructions

- Launch the executable with Qt Creator or directly from the command line.
- The program accepts one optional command line argument: The path of an
  image file to load.
- The program will launch a simple graphical user interface consisting of the
  following:
  - A central scrollable area for displaying images
  - A bottom status bar for displaying errors and progress information
  - A menu bar with conventional menu items for opening images and adjusting zoom,
    as well as a menu of image stylization algorithms which can be run on the
    currently displayed image.
- Some image stylization algorithms will request additional input images
  by opening a file browser. The purpose of each additional image will
  be briefly described by the title of the file browser dialog.
  - Presently, all algorithms require additional images that have the same
    pixel dimensions as the primary input image.

## Documentation

Code documentation can be generated by running `doxygen Doxyfile` in this directory.

Documentation generation depends on [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html).

Doxygen will convert specially-formatted source code comments into HTML files,
which can be read and navigated through using a web browser. The HTML
output is placed in './docs/html'. Open './docs/html/index.html' to view the main page.
